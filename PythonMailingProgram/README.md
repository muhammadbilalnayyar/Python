# MailingPythonProgram
 
Because Gmail has problems sending emails to multiple participants. Such as privatization or security.
This program will help automate the process so you don't have to copy and paste emails!

The process is simple:
- First, you need to create a CSV (comma separated values) file for all your participants or receivers. Most importantly, you must have an "email" conflict (for obvious reasons this is necessary) and you can add other values ​​to your liking if you want to use them. (See Receiver Data CSV).
  Note that if your data is on Google Forms, you can just upload it as a squid and use it now.
  Then you need to create an HTML file for your email body. It should be in HTML format to format the email as you wish. (See MailbodySample - HTML)
-Note that you can add placeholders to whatever key you want, such as you are the ٪٪ ٪٪ key and the program will replace it with the value of each participant.
- Next, make sure the sender's account is configured for this type of process because it requires a 2-step verification key to be disabled and Less Secure Apps to be ON.
  Note that all files must be in the same directory as the program or provide the full path.
-Finally, run the program and provide the required information such as sender authenticity and e-mail article.

That's all! Now you can send as many emails as you want, with formatting of your own.
Hope this helps!
